## 🚀 Features Implemented

Below are the key recommendation strategies implemented in this project:

1. **Rating Prediction-based Recommendations** (Collaborative Filtering using Deep Learning)
2. **User-User Similarity via Embeddings**
3. **Anime-Anime Similarity via Embeddings**
4. **Genre Similarity-based Recommendations**
5. **Hybrid: Model + Genre Similarity Recommendations**
6. **Content Matching using Plot Embeddings**
7. **Personalized Genre Preference Scoring**
8. **User-User Similarity via Genre Preferences**
9. **Watch History-based User Similarity**
10. **Origin-Year-based Gap Recommendations**
11. **Divisive/Controversial Anime Recommendations**

📌 *For visualization or brief explanation of each feature, refer to the [📊 Presentations](#-presentations) section below.*


## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🟢 For Google Colab (Recommended)

1. First, create an empty folder named `anime-recommendation-system` in your Google Drive.  
   Now open a Colab notebook and run the following in a cell:

   import os  
   proj_path = "<path-to-anime-recommendation-system-folder-in-Google-Drive>"  
   os.chdir(proj_path)  
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/anime-recommendation-system.git  

Now, close the notebook and open the `anime-recommendation-system` folder.

2. Follow the instructions in the next section i.e. 'Required Data & Models' section to download the required datasets and model files.  
   Place them in their respective folders as described.

3. Run `recommendation_features.ipynb`.  
   The `cd` command is used inside the notebook to navigate to the project folder.  
   You only need to **change the folder path according to your Google Drive** location of the project.

All dependencies will be installed automatically using `!pip install` inside the notebook.

## 📦 Required Data & Models

Download the required files from the links below and place them in the corresponding folders:

- 📁 [Preprocessed Datasets (`created_datasets`)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_bVHyoS_7fgeE5EvjHh4aUqIxiIdcJrs?usp=sharing) → `datasets/created_datasets/`  
  - ✅ Required for running the **main notebook**

- 📁 [Trained Model File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbSTKyevwdZk-SEpiOmMD8EbfDoz-RrV/view?usp=sharing) → `model/`  
  - ✅ Required for running the **main notebook**

- 📁 [Raw Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020) → `datasets/kaggle_dataset/`  
  - 🟡 *Optional – only needed if you want to run the archived notebooks for preprocessing or training*

## ⚠️ Environment Note

This project was developed and tested in **Google Colab (Python 3.11)**.

Installations are handled inside each notebook using `!pip install`, so **Colab users do not need to install anything manually**.

A `requirements.txt` is also provided for running the project locally with the same package versions.

## 📓 How to Use

1. Run `recommendation_features.ipynb` in Google Colab, it is recommended to run the entire notebook first  
2. Then you can experiment with a recommendation method by calling its function 
3. I have included one example under every recommendation method so you can refer to it
4. Get anime recommendations 🎉
